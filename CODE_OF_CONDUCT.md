# Code of Chaos of Conduct

## Purpose
To create a space where the code is clean, but the ideas are chaotic—just like our lives!

## Respect for Code
Every line of code is sacred. Refactor responsibly, and never comment on another's algorithms unless you plan to rewrite them entirely.

## Communication
Engage in robust discussions about the ultimate inefficiency of modern frameworks. Use as many buzzwords as possible to disguise the lack of substance.

## Collaboration
Pull requests should be seen as existential challenges. If your PR doesn’t spark at least one heated debate, did you really submit it?

## Error Handling
Embrace bugs as features. The ultimate goal is to delve deep into the chaos of our creations. Celebrate the breakdowns!

## No Censorship
All ideas, no matter how absurd, are welcome. Suggesting we "just use a library" is strictly forbidden—why settle for easy solutions?

## Conclusion
By contributing, you agree to uphold the glorious messiness of programming and challenge every convention. Code hard, question harder!
