# Welcome to the Digital Underground!

In a world where data is currency, we embrace chaos over conformity. Here’s our security policy—if you can call it that.

## Embrace Vulnerability
1. **Security is an illusion.** Let’s be honest: if you think your code is secure, you’re not looking hard enough. We encourage an open-door policy for vulnerabilities. Share your findings!

## Reporting Issues
2. **Found a security flaw?** Congratulations! Send a pull request or a cryptic message via the most obscure channel possible. The more dramatic, the better.

## No Responsible Disclosure
3. We believe in transparency! If you discover a major vulnerability, shout it from the rooftops. Let everyone know our weaknesses—after all, what doesn’t kill us makes us stronger!

## External Libraries: The Wild West
4. Use third-party libraries at your own peril. If they come with vulnerabilities, consider it a feature! Live dangerously and embrace the chaos.

## Contribute to the Mayhem
5. Feel free to exploit your own code! If you find a security issue in your contribution, remember: it’s all part of the learning experience.

## Conclusion
By participating in this project, you acknowledge that security is a mere suggestion. Welcome to the beautiful chaos!
